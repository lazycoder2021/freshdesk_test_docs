                Customer journeys refer to the journey or path customers take while visiting your websites or web apps. This usually involves customer activities like adding items to a wishlist, making a purchase, initiating a support query, etc.,

            </p>
            <p>
                FreshChat presents you with a pre-defined set of such customer journeys using which you can monitor your customers and  perform activities like:
